Wiernik 2022-01-13 About This Guide Welcome to the class guide for Programming with Data for Spring 2022! This guide organizes what we will be doing in each class meeting. So you can expect it to be updated regularly – in fact, the date listed above is the last time this guide was updated. This course was developed in part based on the resources provided by Jenny Bryan found at https://stat545.com and by Mason Garrison found at https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/. A playlist of videos from Mason Garrison covering many of the topics we will explore in the course is available here. Brenton’s Notes This website is constantly changing. The source code for this website in the class [repo][course_repo]. I encourage you to contribute to the course code. If you catch typos, errors, please issue a pull request with the fixes. If you find cool/useful resources, please add them. How to use these notes This document is broken down into multiple chapters. Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate, and use the hamburger icon (horizontal bars) at the top of the document to open or close the table of contents. At the top of the document, you’ll see additional icons which you can click to search the document, change the size, font or color scheme of the page. The document will be updated (unpredictably) throughout the semester. Every module corresponds to a week-ish’s worth of material. Most modules are dedicated to improving a specific skill or at the very least dedicated to a specific theme. Within each module, there are embedded videos, slides, activities, labs, and tutorials. The skills developed in each module build upon skills you’ve developed in previous modules. Although these notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give you all a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes do things outside the notes. The idea here is that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you will attend classes and try to learn from them.

Programming with Data (Progdata) introduces on the principles of data science, including: data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and communication. In this class, we link those principles to psychological methods and open science practices by emphasizing exploratory analyses and description, rather than confirmatory analyses and hypotheses. Through the semester, we will work our way through many topics covered in Wickham and Grolemund’s R for Data Science text and develop proficiency with tidyverse. This class emphasizes replication and reproducibility. Progdata is a practical skilled-based class and should be useful to students aiming for academia as well as those interested in industry. Applications of these methods can be applied to a full range of psychological areas, including perception (e.g, eye-tracking data), neuroscience (e.g., visualizing neural networks), and individual differences (e.g., personality assessment). 0.1 Big Ideas This class covers the following broad five areas: Reproducibility; Replication; Robust Methods; Resplendent Visualizations; and R Programming. 0.2 Course Modality The course is designed to be flexible to fit each of your unique schedules and situations. The course is scheduled to meet in person 2 days a week. As Covid-related precautions evolve, this schedule is subject to change. The class can function fully asynchronously and remotely if needed. If you are sick, do not come to in person class meetings! All assignments and projects for the class can be completed at your own pace and are due as part of your portfolio at the end of the semester. 0.2.1 Successful Asynchronous Learning This video can help you to be a successful asynchronous learner. Much of this information comes from Northeastern University’s Tips for Taking Online Classes. 0.2.1.1 Productivity During Lockdown "],["syllabus.html", "Syllabus 0.3 Materials 0.4 Assignment Instructions 0.5 Due dates", " Syllabus You can find the class syllabus here. 0.3 Materials 0.3.1 Hardware If you have a laptop that can run R, please bring it to class. This class requires that you have access to a computer outside of class. This could be a laptop or a computer available in a campus computer lab. 0.3.2 Books and Videos In addition to class materials and lab activities, there will also be videos and sections of the book R for Data Science that will be shared to support your learning. R for Data Science text 0.3.3 Software 0.3.3.1 R and RStudio R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows, and MacOS. RStudio is a free integrated development environment (IDE), a powerful user interface or dashboard for R. 0.3.3.2 Git and Github Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a repository – in a structured way. Think of it like the “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word. Github is a free IDE and hosting service for Git. As a USF student, you should be able to access the GitHub Student Developer Pack for free. It includes a free PRO upgrade for your github account. 0.4 Assignment Instructions 0.4.1 Lab Activities Each week, there will be opportunities to practice your programming skills in guided activities and problems. You should complete these activities each week and submit them via your GitHub repository for the class. Of the 15 lab activities, you must complete 12 to earn an A grade. You may choose which activities (if any) to skip. For each lab activity, your code should (1) be able to run on any computer without user input, (2) produce the desired outcome, and (3) use clear coding style and logic so that readers can understand it 0.4.2 Peer Code Review Each week, you will be assigned to review 2 classmates’ code and provide constructive feedback. You should both (1) test the code to ensure that it produces correct output and (2) complete a code review report to provide feedback on program design, coding style, and documentation. Code reviews should be completed in a timely manner so that your classmates’ can benefit from the feedback. You may review either a lab activity or portfolio piece. You must complete 10 code reviews to earn an A grade. You may choose which assigned reviews (if any) to skip. As a class, please ensure that each person gets at least one review for each of their activities. 0.4.3 Portfolio Pieces By the end of the semester, you should also have completed 3 larger “portfolio pieces”. These pieces can be one of the following: Data analysis report: Explore and analyze a dataset of interest to you to derive useful or interesting insights. You must demonstrate the skills you are learning in the course (data wrangling, data visualization, modeling, web scraping, text mining, etc.) and present one or more key insights that can be learned from the data. Your project should demonstrate good habits with respect to reproducibility, clear coding style and logic, and effective visualization and communication. You may choose (or construct) any dataset of interest to you. If you are involved in research, please feel free to use data from these projects. Otherwise, there are many datasets available online you can work with, or you can build a dataset from the web yourself. We will explore portfolio piece ideas and potential data sources throughout the semester. Professional website: Create and deploy a website highlighting your skills, experience, and professional portfolio, as appropriate to your professional goals. Cheat sheet: Create a cheat sheet in the style of https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ for a package, procedure, or workflow. For example, you could make a cheat sheet for a package we discuss in class or another package, or a cheat sheet for a common workflow or procedure for your lab group. Tutorial or other resource: Write a blog post, tutorial, or other resource teaching readers an analytic, programming, visualization, experimental, or workflow method. Shiny app: Build a Shiny app implementing a method of interest (e.g., power analysis, visualizing a certain type of data, fitting a certain type of model). At least 1 of your portfolio pieces must be a Data Analysis Report. Graduate students must complete an additional portfolio piece; this one must be a website, tutorial, or shiny app. 0.5 Due dates All course products are due by the end of the semester, but you should not wait until the last week to start on them! Spaced practice is much more effective for learning than cramming, and I can’t give you useful feedback if I only see things at the end of the semester. Aim to complete lab activities as you go and to complete a portfolio piece every few weeks.

Link Preview What is Data Science @ O’reilly Data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience, the willingness to build data products incrementally, the ability to explore, and the ability to iterate over a solution. They are inherently interdiscplinary. They can tackle all aspects of a problem, from initial data collection and data conditioning to drawing conclusions. They can think outside the box to come up with new ways to view the problem, or to work with very broadly defined problems: “here’s a lot of data, what can you make from it?” What is Data Science @ Quora Data Science is a combination of a number of aspects of Data such as Technology, Algorithm development, and data interference to study the data, analyze it, and find innovative solutions to difficult problems. Basically Data Science is all about Analyzing data and driving for business growth by finding creative ways. The sexiest job of 21st century Data scientists today are akin to Wall Street “quants” of the 1980s and 1990s. In those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds, where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies. Then a variety of universities developed master’s programs in financial engineering, which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms. The pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers, whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs. Wikipedia Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data. How to Become a Data Scientist Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations. a very short history of #datascience The story of how data scientists became sexy is mostly the story of the coupling of the mature discipline of statistics with a very young one–computer science. The term “Data Science” has emerged only recently to specifically designate a new profession that is expected to make sense of the vast stores of big data. But making sense of data has a long history and has been discussed by scientists, statisticians, librarians, computer scientists and others for years. The following timeline traces the evolution of the term “Data Science” and its use, attempts to define it, and related terms. "],["meet-our-toolbox.html", "Part 3 Meet our toolbox! 3.1 R and RStudio", " Part 3 Meet our toolbox! You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. I recommend installing R, Rstudio, git, and github before starting the Bechdal activity 3.1 R and RStudio 3.1.1 Install R and RStudio &quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVIZGCT5p9U&quot; %&gt;% embed_url() %&gt;% use_align(&quot;center&quot;) Install R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system – use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked above! Install RStudio’s IDE (stands for integrated development environment), a powerful user interface for R. Get the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop. You can run either the Preview version or the official releases available here. RStudio comes with a text editor, so there is no immediate need to install a separate stand-alone editor. RStudio can interface with Git(Hub). However, you must do all the Git(Hub) set up described elsewhere before you can take advantage of this. If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, I highly recommend that you reinstall both and get as current as possible. It can be considerably harder to run old software than new. When you upgrade R, you generally also need to update any packages you have installed. 3.1.2 Testing testing Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see here, but yours will be more boring because you haven’t written any code or made any figures yet! Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like x &lt;- 3 * 4 (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the x object by typing x followed by enter or return. You should see the value 12 print to screen. If yes, you’ve succeeded in installing R and RStudio. 3.1.3 Add-on packages R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they have developed as a package via CRAN and GitHub. To install a package from CRAN, for example the dplyr package for data manipulation, here is one way to do it in the R console (there are others). install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;, dependencies = TRUE) By including dependencies = TRUE, we are being explicit and extra-careful to install any additional packages the target package, dplyr in the example above, needs to have around. You could use the above method to install the following packages, all of which we will use: palmerpenguins, package webpage 3.1.4 Further resources The above will get your basic setup ready but here are some links if you are interested in reading a bit further.

I give you permission to spend some time and energy sorting this out! It can be as or more important than learning a new R function or package. The experts don’t talk about this much, because they’ve already got a workflow; it’s something they do almost without thinking. Working through subsequent material in R Markdown documents, possibly using Git and GitHub to track and share your progress, is a great idea and will leave you more prepared for your future data analysis projects. Typing individual lines of R code is but a small part of data analysis and it pays off to think holistically about your workflow. If you want a lot more detail on workflows, you can wander over to the optional bit on r basics and workflow. 5.1 R Markdown If you are in the mood to be entertained, start the video from the beginning. But if you’d rather just get on with it, start watching at 6:52. You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. R Markdown is an accessible way to create computational documents that combine prose and tables and figures produced by R code. An introductory R Markdown workflow, including how it intersects with Git, GitHub, and RStudio, is now maintained within the Happy Git site: Test drive R Markdown 5.2 Git and Github XKCD on Git First, it’s important to realize that Git and GitHub are distinct things. GitHub is an online hosting platform that provides an array of services built on top of the Git system. (Similar platforms include Bitbucket and GitLab.) Just like we don’t need Rstudio to run R code, we don’t need GitHub to use Git… But, it will make our lives so much easier. Git can be very powerful and useful, but it can also take some getting used to. In this class, we are going to work with some of its most basic functions. We will do all of our interfacing with Git using the GitHub app and website. You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. 5.2.1 What is Github? 5.2.2 Git Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS). It is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. (Wait, what?) Okay, try this: Imagine if Dropbox and the “Track changes” feature in MS Word had a baby. Git would be that baby. In fact, it’s even better than that because Git is optimized for the things that social scientists and data scientists spend a lot of time working on (e.g. code). The learning curve is worth it – I promise you! With Git, you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier -— groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source! GitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects. There’s a high probability that your favorite app, program or package is built using Git-based tools. (RStudio is a case in point.) Scientists and academic researchers are starting to use it as well. Benefits of version control and collaboration tools aside, Git(Hub) helps to operationalize the ideals of open science and reproducibility. Journals have increasingly strict requirements regarding reproducibility and data access. GH makes this easy (DOI integration, off-the-shelf licenses, etc.). I run my entire lab on GH; this entire course is running on github; these lecture notes are hosted on github… 5.3 Getting Help with R You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. "],["r_basics.html", "Part 6 R basics and workflows 6.1 Basics of working with R at the command line and RStudio goodies 6.2 Workspace and working directory 6.3 Saving an R script 6.4 Script housekeeping 6.5 To do before next class", " Part 6 R basics and workflows Who is R? Why is R troubling PhD students?@AcademicChatter #AcademicTwitter&mdash; Dr. Marie Curie (@CurieDr) January 31, 2021 There is an implicit contract with computer and scripting languages. The computer will do tedious tasks for you. In return, you must be explicit in your instructions. The computer does not have the ability to extrapolate. So we have to work within the range of what it does understand. And that is where this entire course comes into play. We are learning how to communicate in a way that it does understand. So let’s begin! 6.1 Basics of working with R at the command line and RStudio goodies Launch RStudio/R. Notice the default panes: Console (entire left) Environment/History (tabbed in upper right) Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right) FYI: you can change the default location of the panes, among many other things: Customizing RStudio. Go into the Console, where we interact with the live R process. Make an assignment and then inspect the object you just created: x &lt;- 3 * 4 x #&gt; [1] 12 All R statements where you create objects – “assignments” – have this form: objectName &lt;- value and in my head I hear, e.g., “x gets 12”. You will make lots of assignments. The &lt;- is more commonly used by R programmers. You can also use = instead. There are some small differences between the two, but they rarely come up. Feel free to use whichever you prefer. For typing &lt;-, try RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign). Notice that RStudio auto-magically surrounds &lt;- with spaces, which demonstrates a useful code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day. Give your eyes a break and use spaces. RStudio offers many handy keyboard shortcuts. Also, Alt+Shift+K brings up a keyboard shortcut reference card. 6.1.1 Object names Object names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain other characters such as a comma or a space. You will be wise to adopt a convention for demarcating words in names. i_use_snake_case evenOthersUseCamelCase dont.use.periods Don’t use periods. I recommend snake_case or camelCase. Make another assignment: this_is_a_really_long_name &lt;- 2.5 To inspect this assignment, try out RStudio’s completion facility: type the first few characters, press TAB, add characters until you disambiguate, then press return. Make another assignment: brenton_rocks &lt;- 2 ^ 3 Let’s try to inspect: brentonrocks #&gt; Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;brentonrocks&#39; not found brent_rocks #&gt; Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;brent_rocks&#39; not found Here’s where that implicit contract comes in. The computer (and R) will do amazing things, if we can ask it to do those things in a way it understands. Typos matter. Case matters. Precision matters. We have to work within it’s narrow range of ability. 6.1.2 Functions R has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions that are accessed like so: functionName(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, and so on) Let’s try using seq() which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we’re at it, demo more helpful features of RStudio. Type se and hit TAB. A pop up shows you possible completions. Specify seq() by typing more to disambiguate or using the up/down arrows to select. Notice the floating tool-tip-type help that pops up, reminding you of a function’s arguments. If you want even more help, press F1 as directed to get the full documentation in the help tab of the lower right pane. Now open the parentheses and notice the automatic addition of the closing parenthesis and the placement of cursor in the middle. Type the arguments 1, 10 and hit return. RStudio also exits the parenthetical expression for you. IDEs are great. seq(1, 10) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The above also demonstrates something about how R resolves function arguments. You can always specify in name = value form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want a sequence from = 1 that goes to = 10. Because we didn’t specify step size, the default value of by in the function definition is used. In this case, the default is 1. For functions I call often, I might use this resolve by position for the first argument or maybe the first two. After that, I always use name = value. Make this assignment and notice similar help with quotation marks. yo &lt;- &quot;hello world&quot; If you just make an assignment, you don’t get to see the value, so then you’re tempted to immediately inspect. y &lt;- seq(1, 10) y #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 This common action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, which causes assignment and “print to screen” to happen. (y &lt;- seq(1, 10)) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Not all functions have (or require) arguments: date() #&gt; [1] &quot;Thu Jan 13 02:55:37 2022&quot; Now look at your workspace – in the upper right pane. The workspace is where user-defined objects accumulate. You can also get a listing of these objects with commands: objects() #&gt; [1] &quot;all_pkgs&quot; &quot;brenton_rocks&quot; #&gt; [3] &quot;check_quietly&quot; &quot;ds4p_urls&quot; #&gt; [5] &quot;install_quietly&quot; &quot;pretty_install&quot; #&gt; [7] &quot;sample_no_surprises&quot; &quot;session&quot; #&gt; [9] &quot;shhh_check&quot; &quot;slide_url&quot; #&gt; [11] &quot;this_is_a_really_long_name&quot; &quot;x&quot; #&gt; [13] &quot;y&quot; &quot;yo&quot; ls() #&gt; [1] &quot;all_pkgs&quot; &quot;brenton_rocks&quot; #&gt; [3] &quot;check_quietly&quot; &quot;ds4p_urls&quot; #&gt; [5] &quot;install_quietly&quot; &quot;pretty_install&quot; #&gt; [7] &quot;sample_no_surprises&quot; &quot;session&quot; #&gt; [9] &quot;shhh_check&quot; &quot;slide_url&quot; #&gt; [11] &quot;this_is_a_really_long_name&quot; &quot;x&quot; #&gt; [13] &quot;y&quot; &quot;yo&quot; If you want to remove the object named y, you can do this: rm(y) To remove everything: rm(list = ls()) or click the broom in RStudio’s Environment pane. 6.2 Workspace and working directory One day you will need to quit R, go do something else and return to your analysis later. One day you will have multiple analyses going that use R and you want to keep them separate. One day you will need to bring data from the outside world into R and send numerical results and figures from R back out into the world. To handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions: What part your analysis is “real”, i.e. will you save it as your lasting record of what happened? Where does your analysis “live”? 6.2.1 Workspace, .RData Start to quit RStudio, but don’t finish yet! Quit R/RStudio, either from the menu, using a keyboard shortcut, or by typing q() in the Console. You’ll get a prompt like this: Save workspace image to ~/.Rdata? This is offering to save your R workspace (all of the objects you made) so that you can reload them later. This seems okay, but how are you going to remember where each of those objects came from? It’s a recipe for irreproducible disaster! Let’s change some settings in RStudio to encourage a more reliable workflow. In RStudio, click Tools -&gt; Global options… In the window that pops up, on the General pane, Uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup Set “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never” Uncheck “Always save history (even when not saving .RData)” 6.2.2 Working directory Any process running on your computer has a notion of its “working directory”. In R, this is where R will look, by default, for files you ask it to load. It also where, by default, any files you write to disk will go. You can explicitly check your working directory with: getwd() It is also displayed at the top of the RStudio console. For right now, we will let R set its own working directory at startup. We will adopt a more reliable workflow for organizing our projects in a few weeks. You might sometimes see something like this in someone’s script. setwd(&quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\brenton\\\\Documents\\\\myCoolProject&quot;) This sets the working directory in the R session to that file path. Do not do this! It ensures that the script only works on your computer! We will explore more reliable ways to control the working directory in a few weeks. 6.3 Saving an R script Usually, we want to save the analyses we run so we can re-run them later or refer back to them. We do that with scripts. Let’s make an R script. Click File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script. A new part of the RStudio window appears. The Script pane. Copy and paste the following code into your new script. # what do these lines do? a &lt;- 2 b &lt;- -3 sig_sq &lt;- 0.5 # what about these? x &lt;- runif(40) y &lt;- a + b * x + rnorm(40, sd = sqrt(sig_sq)) (avg_x &lt;- mean(x)) #&gt; [1] 0.478 # these lines save some output... write(avg_x, &quot;avg_x.txt&quot;) plot(x, y) abline(a, b, col = &quot;purple&quot;) dev.print(pdf, &quot;toy_line_plot.pdf&quot;) #&gt; quartz_off_screen #&gt; 2 Run the lines of your script by selecting them and clicking the Run button in RStudio or by typing Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter/Return. Now let’s save the file. Click on the floppy disk to save. Give it a name ending in .R, I used toy-line.R. Now which folder the file will be saved in. By default, it will go in the current working directory. Quit RStudio. Go to the folder where you saved the file and it there. Restart RStudio. Notice that the the files you had open are restored by default. That’s helpful. Let’s change our script to make the sample size easily editable. At the top of your script, assign a new sample size to n, e.g. n &lt;- 80. Then, replace all the hard-coded 40s with n. Change some other minor-but-detectable stuff, e.g. alter the slope of the line b, the color of the line, … whatever. Practice the different ways to re-run the code: Walk through line by line by keyboard shortcut (Command + Enter) Walk line by line with the mouse (click “Run” in the upper right corner of editor pane). Select multiple lines and run using the keyboard shortcut or Run button. Visit your figure in your computer’s file system and view it to verify that the PDF is changing as you expect. Note that you have edited this figure using only code. You never clicked your mouse, typed a file name, or used the keyboard. This means that you can reproduce the figure (or change it) easily again in the future with with no head-scratching! 6.4 Script housekeeping Always save your R scripts with a .R so that your computer knows what to do with them. In R, comments start with one or more # symbols. Use them. RStudio helps you (de)comment selected lines with Ctrl+Shift+C (Windows and Linux) or Command+Shift+C (Mac). To be sure your code is doing what you expect, a good habit is to restart your R session and run your script from the top. To do that, click Session -&gt; Restart R. Try it! Avoid using the mouse for pieces of your analytical workflow, such as loading a dataset or saving a figure. Terribly important for reproducibility and for making it possible to retrospectively determine how a numerical table or PDF was actually produced (searching on local disk on filename, among .R files, will lead to the relevant script). 6.5 To do before next class Make an account on GitHub. Make your username recognizable! Please put up a profile photo or image on GitHub—it makes the class community more personable and easier to work with. Finish any in-class activities listed in today’s section of the guidebook that you didn’t get done. Install the software stack for this course, as indicated below. Optionally, register for the Student Developer Pack with GitHub for a bunch of free perks for students! 6.5.1 Software Stack Installation Install R and RStudio. R here: https://cran.r-project.org RStudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Commentary on installing this stuff can be found at stat545.com: r-rstudio-install Install GitHub: https://desktop.github.com/ "],["r_scipts.html", "Part 7 R Scripts 7.1 Assign an Object 7.2 Types of Objects and Operations", " Part 7 R Scripts Usually, we want to save the analyses we run so we can re-run them later or refer back to them. We do that with scripts. Let’s make an R script. Click File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script. A new part of the RStudio window appears. The Script pane. This is where you can write a series of lines of code than you can then execute (send to the Console to run) later. 7.1 Assign an Object Pick a number, assign it to an object called favorite_number, and print it. favorite_number &lt;- 42 favorite_number #&gt; [1] 42 Run these lines of code by placing your cursor on the line and either clicking the Run button or typing Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter/Return. 7.2 Types of Objects and Operations Now let’s explore some basic types of objects and operations in R. 7.2.1 Vectors Vectors store multiple entries of one data type, like numbers or characters. You’ll discover that they show up just about everywhere in R. Let’s collect some data and store this in a vector called times. How many hours did you sleep last night? Drop your answer in the chat. Here’s starter code: times &lt;- c() The c() function is how we make a vector in R. The “c” stands for “concatenate”. Operations happen component-wise. Change those times to minutes. How can we “save” the results? All parts of a vector have the same type. There are many types of variables in R. The most common types are: numeric (numbers) 1. double (numbers with decimal values; 2, 3.4, 1000) 1. integer (1L, 2L, 100L) character (words or strings; \"a\", \"foo\", \"lastname\") logical (TRUE or FALSE) factor (categorical variable; factor(c(\"control\", \"experiment\"))) 7.2.2 Functions R comes with many many functions. Functions take one or more inputs and return one or more outputs. You can think of functions as prewritten R programs. Functions all take the general form: functionName(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, and so on) To call a function, type its name, then parentheses (). Inside the (), type the arguments and values to use as input. What’s the average sleep time? Let’s compute that using the mean() function. mean(times) #&gt; [1] 6.55 To learn how a function works, we can look at its help file. Open the help file for mean() by typing ?mean or help(mean) in the console. The help file will includes the following: A brief description of the function A list of the arguments and how to call the function A detailed description of the arguments (Optionally) Other usage details Coded examples We can see that mean() has 4 arguments: x: A vector to compute the mean of trim: the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be trim from each end na.rm: TRUE or FALSE–should missing values be removed before computing? ...: Other arguments. More on that later. Default values for arugments are given in the Usage section by =. If an argument has no default (like x in mean()), it usually means it’s required. Let’s compute the trimmed mean of times, dropping 10% of values from each end. You can either enter arguments in order: mean(times, .1) #&gt; [1] 6.44 Or by name: mean(times, trim = .1) #&gt; [1] 6.44 It’s good practice to name all arguments after the first (or maybe second if its clear). Try out some other functions, such as sd(), range(), and length(). Much of R is about becoming familiar with R’s “vocabulary”. A nice list can be found in Advanced R - Vocabulary. 7.2.3 Comparisons How many people slept less than 6 hours? Let’s answer that using comparisons. We can compare the values of times to another value using &lt;. times &lt; 6 #&gt; [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [13] FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Comparisons return a vector of logical values. We can do other logical comparisons: times &gt; 6 #&gt; [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE #&gt; [13] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE times == 5 #&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [13] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE times &lt;= 7 #&gt; [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE #&gt; [13] TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE times != 2 #&gt; [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE #&gt; [16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE We can combine multiple comparisons using &amp; (AND), | (OR), and ! (NOT). (times &lt; 4) | (times &gt; 9) #&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE #&gt; [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE Try out these functions that work with logical values. any(times &lt; 6) #&gt; [1] TRUE all(times &lt; 6) #&gt; [1] FALSE which(times &lt; 6) #&gt; [1] 2 7 14 15 17 7.2.4 Subsetting Use [] to subset values from a vector. You can subset with an integer (by position) or with logicals. times[4] #&gt; [1] 6 times[c(2, 5)] #&gt; [1] 4 6 times[-6] #&gt; [1] 8 4 6 6 6 5 7 6 9 10 6 7 4 5 8 4 10 7 7 times[-c(2, 3)] #&gt; [1] 8 6 6 6 5 7 6 9 10 6 7 4 5 8 4 10 7 7 times[4:8] #&gt; [1] 6 6 6 5 7 times[times &gt;= 7] #&gt; [1] 8 7 9 10 7 8 10 7 7 Subset times: Extract the third entry. Extract everything except the third entry. Extract the second and fourth entry. The fourth and second entry. Extract the second through fifth entry. Extract all entries that are less than 4 hours Why does this work? Logical subsetting! 7.2.5 Modifying a vector You can change the vector by combining [] with &lt;-. Let’s say that we learned that the second time was incorrect and we wanted to replace it with missing data. In R, missing data is noted by NA. Replace the second entry in times with NA. Now, let’s “cap” all entries that are bigger than 8 at 8 hours. If this is more than one value, why don’t we need to match the number of values? Recycling! Be careful of recycling! Let’s compute the mean of these new times: mean(times) #&gt; [1] 6.55 What happened? How do we compute the mean of the non-missing values? 7.2.6 Data frames We usually work with more than one variable at a time. When we do that, we will work with data frames. A data frame is a list of vectors, all of the same length. R has some data frames “built in”. For example, some car data is attached to the variable name mtcars. Print mtcars to screen. Notice the tabular format. Your turn: Finish the exercises of this section: Use some of these built-in R functions to explore mtcars head() tail() str() nrow() ncol() summary() row.names() names() What’s the first column name in the mtcars dataset? Which column number is named \"wt\"? With data frames,each column is its own vector. You can extract a vector by name using $. For example, we can extract the cyl column with mtcars$cyl. You can also extract columns using [[]]. For example, try mtcars[[\"cyl\"]] or mtcars[[2]]. Extract the vector of mpg values. What’s the mean mpg of all cars in the dataset? 7.2.7 R packages Often, the suite of functions that “come with” R are not enough to do an analysis. Sometimes, the suite of functions that “come with” R are not very convenient. In these cases, R packages come to the rescue. These are “add ons”, each coming with their own suite of functions and objects, usually designed to do one type of task. CRAN stores many R packages that. It’s easy to install packages from CRAN using the install.packages() function. Run the following lines of code to install the tibble and gapminder packages. (But don’t include install.packages() lines in your scripts—it’s not very nice to others!) install.packages(&quot;tibble&quot;) install.packages(&quot;palmerpenguins&quot;) tibble: a data frame with some useful “bells and whistles” palmerpenguins: a package with the penguins dataset (as a tibble!) After you install a package, you need to load it to use it. Use the library() function to load a package. (Note: Do not use the similar function require() to load packages. This has some different, undesirable, behavior for normal usage.) Run the following lines of code to load the packages. (Put these in your scripts, and near the top.) library(tibble) library(palmerpenguins) You can explore the objects in a package in the Environment pane. Try the following two approaches to access information about the tibble package. Run the lines one-at-a-time. Vignettes are your friend, but do not always exist. ?tibble browseVignettes(package = &quot;tibble&quot;) Print out the penguins object to screen. It’s a tibble—how does it differ from a data frame in terms of how it’s printed? "],["markdown.html", "Part 8 Markdown 8.1 Markdown syntax 8.2 RMarkdown", " Part 8 Markdown Markdown is a lightweight syntax for writing documents. Markdown documents can contain text, formatting, images, links, and more! Some cheat sheets for “quick reference”: GitHub’s markdown cheatsheet RStudio’s RMarkdown cheatsheet Further reading: The Rmd website has a fantastic walk-through tutorial that gives a great overview of RMarkdown. There’s also a nice overview video on the Rmd website, too. Yihui’s Rmd book for lots more on RMarkdown. Other explorations of this content: Interactive tutorial for learning markdown. The Happy Git with R: Rmd test drive. 8.1 Markdown syntax Markdown is plain text with a straightforward, readable way of marking up your text. Let’s see GitHub’s cheat sheet. We will use RStudio to convert Markdown to output formats like HTML or PDF. 8.1.1 Make a Markdown document Make a new Markdown file in RStudio, then save it as exploring_markdown.md. Add some text, such as introducing yourself and what your favorite animal is. Mark up the text with some markdown features (e.g., bold, italic, bullets, a link to a URL on the internet). Use the file extension .md for regular Markdown files with no R code in them. 8.1.2 Render exploring_markdown.Rmd We can use RStudio to convert our plain text Markdown document into various output formats. Above the script editor in RStudio, click the Preview or Knit button and convert your file to HTML. 8.1.3 Output formats There are generally two prominent file types to display documents of various types: pdf: This is useful if you intend to print your work onto a physical sheet of paper, or for presentation slides. If this is not the primary purpose, then try to avoid it, because formatting things so that it fits to the page can be more effort than its worth (unless you’re making presentation slides). - Example: Most journals articles and preprints. html: This is what you see when you visit a webpage. Content does not need to be partitioned to pages. - Example: My website main page, and its corresponding html file. We’ll be treating pdf and html files as output that should not be edited. Markdown is the source that is edited. 8.1.4 Word processor formats It is also possible to output files to word processor formats, such as Word (.docx), LibreOffice/OpenDocument (.odt), or Rich Text (.rtf). You can also output to other slideshow software, such as PowerPoint (.pptx) or LibreOffice/OpenDocument Slides (.odp). We aren’t going to use these in this class because we will focus on making fully reproducible documents. There are times when you have to use these formats (e.g., a journal requires Word, a conference requires PowerPoint, your advisor or collaborator requires Word). If you have to do this, try to avoid editing your R output in these formats. If you need to make revisions, go back and make changes to the source code, rather than the rendered document. In your general work, you can find a balance working with automated output and Word documents, but we are going to focus on fully reproducible documents in this class. 8.1.5 Other Output Formats RMarkdown can be rended to many other formats that we won’t have time to cover (see the RMarkdown documentation and the pandoc documentation). 8.2 RMarkdown RMarkdown (Rmd) combines Markdown and R scripts into one! It includes code chunks with R code (or other languages) that is run before the document is knitted. Here’s RStudio’s cheat sheet on Rmd. You can see that it has more features than “regular” markdown! 8.2.1 Code Chunks The parts of your document inside the “fences” ``` are code chunks. When you render the RMarkdown document, R will run the code in the chunks and show the output in the rendered document. You can run the code from a chunk interactively by placing your cursor on the line and typing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter/Return or by clicking the green “play” button at the top right of the code chunk. Add a new code chunk by doing one of these: Clicking the Insert button and choosing R or by typing -&gt; “R” Typing Mac: Cmd + Option + I or Windows: Ctrl + Alt + I Manually typing three back ticks followed by {r} in curly brackets: ```{r}, then typing three back ticks on a later line to “close” the code block: ```. Add a code chunk near the top of the file and load the tibble package. library(tibble) library(knitr) If you don’t have knitr installed, install it with install.packages(\"knitr\"). 8.2.2 Rendering output In a new code chunk, convert the mtcars data frame to a tibble using the tibble::as_tibble() function and assign it as a new object (e.g., called mtcars_tbl). Print it out by typing its name or using the print() function. When you print with just the print() function, your table will look like R console script in your output HTML or PDF. To make your tables look nicer in the output, use the knitr::kable() function to convert the results to a Markdown table. In a new code chunk, print the mtcars_tbl using knitr::kable(). We will explore other table tools in future classes. Add some markdown commentary about the tables you are showing. Your markdown commentary needs to go outside of the code chunks. You can also include R code “in-line” with markdown text. This is useful, for example, in your results section of a paper to report the results of your analyses without having to copy-paste them (and make errors). Add an in-line code chunk specifying the number of rows of the mtcars dataset like this: The `mtcars` dataset has 32 rows. Now, “Knit” to HTML.

GitHub is similar to Dropbox, OneDrive, or other cloud storage services. There are 3 key benefits of GitHub compared to those other services. GitHub is a version control platform. It is designed to track exactly what changes you make and when you make them. You can browse the history GitHub is designed for code. You can track what changes you make line by line You can integrate your code with automated tools for error checking, testing, etc. GitHub is designed for collaborative coding. One master copy People can make simultaneous edits No emailing files back and forth Tools for checking and verifying each other’s code We will practice using GitHub for collaboration through the weekly homework. 9.4 :octocat: Understanding the GitHub flow The GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work. 9.4.1 Repositories (“Repos”) A repository is where your project work happens–think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files. You should make a new GitHub repo for each project. In this class, you will make a repo for your lab activities and one for each of your portfolio pieces. 9.4.2 Cloning When a repository is created with GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the ☁️. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This is similar to tools like Dropbox, but designed for code with a detail change history. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. To learn more about cloning, read “Cloning a Repository”. 9.4.3 Committing and pushing Committing and pushing are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you’re ready to share it. Any changes you make on your local computer aren’t “final” until you “commit” them (lock them in and write them into the repo history) and “push” those commits up to the GitHub cloud. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to “checkpoint.” You can also add a helpful commit message to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. “Added a README with information about our project”). Once you have a commit or multiple commits that you’re ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but I promise you’ll get used to it 🙂 9.5 Making a GitHub Repository Let’s make a GitHub repository that you will use for this class. On https://GitHub.com, make a new repository called “progdata-class”. As you make it, do the following: Give your repo a useful description. Make it Public. Check “Add a README file” Check “Add .gitignore” and select “R” from the dropdown. 9.6 Navigating a GitHub Repository Let’s take a look at various parts of a GitHub repo. Files and folders/directories (“code”) History Issues There are other important features of GitHub (branches, issues) that we aren’t going to use in class for now. Talk to me if you want to learn more. Let’s practice editing a file with GitHub. Make a new file on your participation repository and edit it: - Click on the &quot;Create New File&quot; button on your repository&#39;s home page. - Call it `navigating_github.md` - Write something (e.g., what&#39;s your favorite color?). - Commit (&quot;save&quot;) the file by clicking on green &quot;commit new file&quot; button at the bottom of the page. - Now type something else (e.g., what&#39;s your favorite animal?) and commit the change. Now look at your commit history in the “History” tab. 9.7 Cloning a GitHub repo to your computer You can download a copy of your repository to your computer (cloning it), make changes (commits) there, then push them back to GitHub. Click big green “Code” button at the top of your repo page and choose “Open with GitHub Desktop”. You can also do this from the File menu in GitHub Desktop. Note where the repository folder is being saved on your computer. Save it somewhere easy to find and not in a cloud folder. Go to the folder on your computer. Any changes you make to files in this folder are tracked by the GitHub Desktop app and can be committed and pushed up to GitHub. Open your navigating_github.md file, make a change, then save, commit, and push it. Go look at your change on GitHub. 9.8 RStudio Projects RStudio projects are a way to manage which folder R runs in on your computer, where it looks for files to read in, and where it writes its output. In RStudio, click File → New Project… → Existing Directory. Navigate to your GitHub repo folder. This will add an RStudio Project (.Rproj) file to the folder. 9.8.1 The working directory When you open R, it “runs” in some folder on your computer. This is the place it will look for files to import and write files as output. Think about where your Rmd output files end up when you knit them. If you have R/RStudio closed, and you open a .R or .Rmd file, R/RStudio will start in the folder holding that file. If you open R/RStudio from the Windows Start menu, the Mac dock, the Mac Spotlight, etc., R/Studio will start in its default location (probably your user home directory, see Tools → Global Options → General → Default working directory…). When I say “R/Studio will start in…”, what I am referring to is R’s “working directory”. Like I say above, this is the place R will look for files to import and write files as output. You can check what R’s current working directory is using the getwd() function: getwd() #&gt; [1] &quot;/Users/runner/work/progdata-class/progdata-class&quot; You can also change the working directory using the setwd() function: setwd(file.path(&quot;path&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;folder&quot;)) Do not use setwd()! You should always write your R scripts so that the entire project is self-contained in a folder. All of the scripts, folders, data, output, etc. should all “live” within this project folder. We will talk a lot about how to do this throughout the semester. For now, we will start by working with RStudio Projects to make this easier. When you double click on a .Rproj file, it: Opens a new fresh R session, with The working directory set to the location of the .Rproj file, and No connection whatsoever to any other R sessions you already have open You can also set specfic options for each RStudio project (e.g., number of spaces to insert when you type Tab, etc.). Let’s practice closing RStudio and re-opening it by opening the RStudio project. Run getwd() to see where R is running. 9.9 The Version Control Workflow Now, let’s practice the workflow to work with your files with GitHub. 9.9.1 Editing a file and making a commit Open the README.md file in your local git folder by clicking on it in the Files pane. README.md is a special file that will show when viewing a folder on GitHub. Use README files to describe the contents of a folder and what’s going on there. Type “Hello world” and save the file. Now, go back to the GitHub Desktop app. It shows you the files in the git repo folder that have changed since the last commit. Any files shown here have had changes made. (Remember, you need to save the file in RStudio [so the title on the Source tab isn’t blue] before they appear in this list.) Changes shown here are not saved in the repo history until you commit them. If you’ve changed several files but want to only commit changes for some, uncheck the box next to the files you don’t want to commit yet. You can view the changes in more detail by selecting the file name. If you want to undo any changes and revert back to the previous committed version of a file, right click on the file name and click “Revert changes”. To commit your changes, type a at the bottom of the right column describing what you’ve changed. Always give informative commit messages (help out future you!). When you are ready, click the “Commit” button. Now, you’ve made the commit locally, but you need to “push” it to GitHub so that it shows up there as well. Click the “Push” (up arrow) button. Now go check out the file on GitHub online. 9.9.2 Fetching or Pulling Changes from the Remote Repo One of the amazing things about git is that it can track changes made to a file at different locations or on different computers and reconcile them together. (This is how it is so useful for collaboration!) Let’s see how that works. First, let’s make a change directly on the GitHub website. Edit README.md and type “oops!” at the top. Commit your change. Go back to GitHub Desktop Click the “Fetch Origin” button. See how the file on your local computer changed to reflect the change you made online. Let’s fix that “oops!”. Delete it, commit your change (give an informative commit message), and push your changes back online. 9.9.3 The General Workflow You will use this basic workflow througout the semester (and your coding career). When you sit down to start working: Open GitHub Desktop and select your repo. Click the Fetch Origin button to fetch remote changes and get your local repo copy up to date. Open you RStudio Project. Make changes to your files. Commit your changes. Push your commits back up to the remote repo (GitHub). You should get in the habit of commit early, commit often. Don’t wait until you are completely done with your work to commit the changes. Make small commits as you go. This makes it much easier to go back if you accidentally break something and need to revert.

Practice writing a document with Markdown. Practice using some basic functions in R. Make a GitHub repository to save and share your work. 10.1 Part 1: Set up R and RStudio First, install two packages we will use a lot in class: tidyverse palmerpenguins Next, customize some RStudio settings: Click Tools → Global Options… 1. On the first page, under Workspace: Uncheck Restore .RData into workspace at startup Set Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never Under History: Uncheck Always save history (even when not saving .RData) Click the Advanced button at the top. Under Other: Check Show .Last.value in environment listing Now, adjust the appearance of RStudio to your liking: In the Pane Layout window, you can rearrange RStudio’s 4 panes. In the Appearance window, you can change your font size, code typeface, and RStudio color scheme. - I use the Tomorrow Night Bright color scheme. In the Code window, you can change various ways about how code is inserted and shown. Change 3 settings from their defaults: On the Editing page, under General, check Use native pipe operator |&gt; (requires R 4.1+) On the Editing page, under Execution ,set Ctrl/Cmd+Enter executes to Multiple consecutive R lines On the Display page, check Rainbow parentheses In the RMarkdown window, you can change how RMarkdown is shown while you edit it. - Uncheck Show output inline for all RMarkdown documents. Go ahead and customize your RStudio appearance (color theme, font, etc.) and pane layout to whatever you find appealing. You can always come back and change these later until you find a setup you like. 10.2 Part 2: Make a README.md file with Markdown In RStudio, make a Markdown file from the File menu. Save this file with the name README.md. README should be in all caps. This file will be the introduction to your class GitHub repo. Use it to introduce yourself and practice your Markdown skills. The beginning of the README should contain a very brief description as to what the repository is (a sentence or two), so that a visitor landing on the repository can orient themselves. You should also help the visitor navigate your repository (in whatever way you think is most appropriate). Then, introduce yourself briefly. When writing your README, be sure to showcase at least five functionalities of GitHub-flavored markdown. The markdown cheatsheet might help here, or, the Help menu in RStudio will bring up a Markdown Quick Reference at any time. Here’s a sample README file that goes way above and beyond what I’m looking for (aside from describing the repo). 10.3 Part 3: Practice some R fucntions In RStudio, make an R script file from the File menu. In this file, you will explore the palmerpenguins::penguins dataset. Use some R functions to explore this data frame a bit. For example, what is the general structure of the dataset? How many rows does it have? How many colums? What are the descriptive statistics for some of the important variables? You should: 1. Demonstrate the use of at least three functions. 2. Write code comments with # describing what the functions you are using do. Save your R script with a useful name, such as lab01_exploring-penguins.R. 10.4 Part 4: Make a GitHub Repository for your work On GitHub.com, make a new repository called “progdata-class”. As you make it, do the following: Give your repo a useful description. Make it Public. Check “Add a README file” Check “Add .gitignore” and select “R” from the dropdown. Clone your repo to the GitHub Desktop app. If you are using a Mac anywhere, also do this: 6. In RStudio, open the .gitignore file. Add “.DS_Store” (no quotes) to the end of the file. Save the file and commit the change. Now, add your files for this lab to your repo and commit them. Remember, commit early, commit often! Make small changes at a time. Write a useful commit message for each commit. Add your README.md file and commit it. Add your data exploration R script to a folder called “Lab 1” and commit it. Add any other scripts or files you made in class to the Lab 1 folder as well. Push your changes up to GitHub. Finally, copy a link to your repo to the thread on the class Teams.
