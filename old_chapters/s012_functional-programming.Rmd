# Let's get functional

## Today

Today, we are going to expand on last week's topic of model-fitting to cover
three important topics:
  1. Using a "functional programming" approach to make your code more efficient
     and avoid "repeating yourself"—copying and pasting essentially the same code
     over and over again 
  2. As part of the functional programming approach, how to write your own
     functions in R to do useful things.

## What is functional programming?

I recommend you start today by watching 
[this presentation](https://youtu.be/bzUmK0Y07ck?t=251) by Hadley Wickham, the 
chief scientist at RStudio and the architect of the tidyverse, on functional 
programming. He uses a really great analogy of baking cupcakes to motivate
why a functional approach is useful, and he demonstrates the skills we will
be using today.

If you don't watch the whole video, at least read through and understand
[the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/hadley/the-joy-of-functional-programming) 
accompanying the presentation.

Until now, you've problem approached each **R** programming task as its own problem:
you figured out what variables you were working with and then wrote code to wrangle,
transform, plot, or model that variable. For example, in last week's activity, 
you looked at gender differences in the Big Five personality traits using the
`psych::bfi` dataset. Your code for that probably looked something like this:

```{r}
bfi <- psychTools::bfi
keys <- replace_na(psychTools::bfi.dictionary$Keying, 1)

bfi_mean <- bfi |> mutate_at(names(bfi)[keys == -1], ~ 7 - .x) |> 
  mutate(A = rowMeans(select(., A1:A5), na.rm = TRUE),
         C = rowMeans(select(., C1:C5), na.rm = TRUE),
         E = rowMeans(select(., E1:E5), na.rm = TRUE),
         N = rowMeans(select(., N1:N5), na.rm = TRUE),
         O = rowMeans(select(., O1:O5), na.rm = TRUE),
         gender = recode_factor(gender, `1` = "male", `2` = "female"),
         education = recode_factor(education, `1` = "some hs", 
                                              `2` = "hs", 
                                              `3` = "some college", 
                                              `4` = "college",
                                              `5` = "graduate degree")) |> 
  select(gender:O)
  
mod_gender_a <- lm(A ~ gender, data = bfi_mean)
mod_gender_c <- lm(C ~ gender, data = bfi_mean)
mod_gender_e <- lm(E ~ gender, data = bfi_mean)
mod_gender_n <- lm(N ~ gender, data = bfi_mean)
mod_gender_o <- lm(O ~ gender, data = bfi_mean)
```

This works, but it can get really tedious. What if you wanted to do this sort
of analysis with 25 varibles? Or 100 variables? What if you wanted to fit a bunch 
of similar, but slightly different, versions of the model (e.g., regressing on
gender, age, education, or a combination of these)? That is a recipe for boredom
and finger cramps at best and typos or errors at worst (potentially with big
consequences if you don't catch them before they are disseminated). 

Functional programming can come to the rescue here. The idea of functional 
programming is that, rather than writing bespoke code for each new analysis 
or each new variable, we can **write the code once** and then 
**apply it over and over again** as needed for new analyses. 

For example, we can streamline the code above using the `map()` function in the
`purrr` package:

```{r}
bfi_just_traits <- select(bfi_mean, A:O)
mods_gender <- 
  map(bfi_just_traits,
      ~ lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean)
      )

# Or, using the pipe without making an intermediate object

mods_gender <- 
  bfi_mean |> 
  select(A:O) |> 
  map(~ lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean))
```

The result of this code is `mods_gender`, a *list* of models, one for each Big 
Five trait. You can then use these pass these models to other functions, such as
`summary()`, `tidy()`, or `glance()`.

```{r}
mods_gender

map(mods_gender, summary)
```

In this way, `map()` lets us write code that is much shorter, easier to read, 
and less prone to copy-paste errors.

Let's dive into how `map()` works.


## Working with `map()`


`map()` takes a data frame, list, or vector as as input and applies the requested 
function to each column of the data frame or element of the list/vector.

This impage illustrates what `map` does: 

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/12f6af8404d9723dff9cc665028a35f07759299d/d0d9a/diagrams/functionals/map-list.png" width=500>

Source: [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham.

*Note*: In this image, the input is a *list* and the function `f()` is applied
to each element of the list. When the input is a *data frame*, the function `f()`
is applied to each *column* of the data frame.

Its arguments look like this:

`map(.x, .f, ...)`

For example, this code takes each column of the `cars` data set and applies the
`mean` function:

```{r}
map(cars, mean)
```

You can see a similar example above where I applied the `summary()` function to
each element of the `mods_gender` list.

Often, you will want to specify additional arguments for the function you are
mapping. The easiest way to do that is using `~`. With `~`, you can write out
a whole function call, similar to `lm(A ~ gender, data = bfi_mean)`. For example:

```{r}
map(cars, ~ mean(.x, trim = .1))
```

When you use `~`, in the function call, `.x` is a **placeholder** that means
"whatever the current variable from the data frame is". So, the above code means
"Take each column of cars and pass to to the `mean()` function with the argument
`trim = .1`."

Accordingly, the gender modeling code above:

```{r}
mods_gender <- 
  bfi_mean |> 
  select(A:O) |> 
  map(~ lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean))
mods_gender
```

means "Take `bfi_mean` and select columns `A` through `O`. For each of these
columns, predict the column using the `lm()` function with `gender` from the
`bfi_mean` data frame as a predictor."

### More details on `map()`

`map()` is the basic mapping function in the `purrr` package. It always returns
a **list**. This is useful for *a lot* of purposes, but there are additional 
`map_*()` functions that also return other outputs. 

For example, let's say that I wanted to return just the `r.squared` value for each
of the gender–Big Five trait models. I could use the `map_dbl()` function, which
returns a numeric vetor instead of a list:

```{r}
rsq_gender <- 
  bfi_mean |> 
    select(A:O) |> 
    map_dbl(~ lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean) |> 
                summary() |> .$r.squared)
rsq_gender
```

`map_dfc()` combines all of the results into the *columns* of a new data frame. 
`map_dfr()` combines all of the results into the *rows* of a new data frame. For
example, to extract the coefficients for all of the models:

```{r}
coef_gender <- 
  bfi_mean |> 
    select(A:O) |> 
    map_dfr(~ lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean) |> 
                coef(),
            .id = "Trait")
coef_gender
```

The `.id` argument gives the name of the variable where the model each row of 
results came from.

Similarly, to get the whole coefficient results tables for each model:

```{r}
coef_summary_gender <- 
  bfi_mean |> 
    select(A:O) |> 
    map_dfr(~ lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean) |> 
                tidy(conf.int = TRUE),
            .id = "Trait")
coef_summary_gender
```

For more information on different types of `map_*()` functions, see the `map()`
help file: `?map()`

You can also map across 2 data frames/lists at once using the `map2_*()` functions
and across as many lists as you want at once using the `pmap_*()` functions, but
we aren't going to get into those in detail today. Check out Chapter 21 of 
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) for some examples
and exercises if you are interested. 


## Writing your own functions

`map()` is a powerful tool for performing the same analysis repeatedly, but it's
possible for the function code you use inside `map()` to get real messy real fast.
For example, look at this example from above:

```
coef_summary_gender <- 
  bfi_mean |> 
    select(A:O) |> 
    map_dfr(~ lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean) |> 
                tidy(conf.int = TRUE),
            .id = "Trait")
coef_summary_gender
```

The function inside `map_dfr()` is a pipe:
`~ lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean) |> tidy(conf.int = TRUE)`

Especially if a pipe like this gets very long, that can be hard to read.

When you write a function with `~`, that's called an "anonymous function"—you
are making up that function on the spot and it isn't being saved for future use.
If your function is complex, it's better to *write and save your function first*, 
then *call your saved function object inside `map()`*.

For example, we can rewrite the above as:

```{r}
get_coef_summary_gender <- function(.x, data) {
  mod <- lm(.x ~ gender, data = bfi_mean)
  return(tidy(mod, conf.int = TRUE))
}

coef_summary_gender <- 
  bfi_mean |> 
    select(A:O) |> 
    map_dfr(get_coef_summary_gender, .id = "Trait")
coef_summary_gender
```

There are two major advanges of writing and saving a function, rather than
using an anonymous function:
  1. Your code is often more readable.
  2. You can reuse the function multiple times throughout your analyses.
  3. Its easier to fix bugs or typos you might make because your code is only
     in one spot.
  
To write a function in R, use the following template:

```
function_name <- function(arguments) {
  # function code
}
```

```
function_name <- function(arg1, arg2, arg3 = FALSE) {
  # function steps go here
  return(result)
}
```

A function as three parts:

  1. Its **name**: how do we call it?
  2. Its **arguments**: what are its inputs?
  3. Its **body**: what does it do with the inputs?

First, pick a name for your function. Like all of your object names, make your
function names clear and unambiguous. `my_awesome_function()` doesn't tell
us anything about what the function does. Usually, I prefer to make my function
names *verbs* to make it clear that they *do* something.

Then, tell R that you are making a function by assigning `function() {}` to your
function name:

```
function_name <- function() {}
```

Your arguments go *inside the parentheses* after `function`. Follow the same basic
guidelines for naming arguments as you do for naming any object in R. Give your 
arguments understandable names and be consistent in your naming scheme.

To give an argument a default value, specify the default with `=`. For example,
this function will take a vector of numbers and draw a histogram of them, 
with the default colorbeing blue:

```{r}
plot_histogram <- function(data, color = "blue") {
  tbl <- tibble(data = data)
  ggplot(tbl, aes(x = data)) +
  geom_histogram(color = color, fill = color)
}
```

If the user of this function doesn't specify a color, the line and fill colors
will be blue:

```{r}
simulated_data <- rnorm(100)
plot_histogram(simulated_data)
```

If the user of the function _does_ specify a color, the line and fill colors will
be the specified color:

```{r}
plot_histogram(simulated_data, color = "black")
```

For more guidance on writing R functions, including advanced features and testing,

## Activities

### Activity 1: `bfi` Models Part 2: Map Attack!

Use the `psych::bfi` dataset again. Compute mean scores for each of the Big Five 
scales for each person. Then, perform the same analyses as last week. But this
time, rather than writing out the code for each model and variable separately,
use `map()` or related functions to do so in a more functional programatic way.
Fit linear models for each Big Five trait, and present your results using both 
tables of results and figures.

1. Do men and women differ on the Big Five traits? How big are the differences?
2. Do the Big Five traits increase or decrease with Age? Is there a linear or 
   squared trend?
3. Do the Big Five traits differ across educational levels? Treat education as 
   a categorical variable.
4. How well do age and gender together predict the Big Five traits?
5. In your models in part (4), do the residuals appear to be normally distributed?
   Are they consistent across age ranges and gender groups?
   
### Activity 2: Individual `bfi` Reports

Select 10 people from the `bfi` dataset. Prepare an individualized report for
each person presenting the following information:

  1. Their mean score on each of the Big Five scales.
  2. The percentile of their mean score compared to the rest of the full sample
     of 2800 people (hint: use the `quantile()` function).
  3. A profile plot illustrating their level on each Big Five trait.
    - For examples, see [here](https://www.unzcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/teddypersonality.png)
      or [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/personality-quiz/).
  4. Bonus: In addition, provide individualized _narrative_ descriptions of what
     each of their scores means (e.g., based on whether they are "high", "medium",
     or "low" on each trait). See the two examples linked above for ideas
     
To save yourself a bunch of tedious report writing, write a function and consider
using a `map_*()` function to automate the process. Take a look at Hadley's slides
and video for some examples! He has R code linked from his talk as well.
