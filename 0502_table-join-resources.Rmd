# Join Functions

Often, we need to work with data living in more than one table. 

There are four main types of operations that can be done with two tables 
(as elaborated in [r4ds Chapter 13 Introduction](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#introduction-7)):

- [__Mutating joins__](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#mutating-joins) 
  add new columns to the "original" tibble.
- [__Filtering joins__](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#filtering-joins) 
  filter the "original" tibble's rows.
- [__Set operations__](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#set-operations) 
  work as if each row is an element in a set. 
- __Binding__ stacks tables on top of or beside each other, with 
  `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()`.

Let's navigate to each of these three links, which lead to the relevant r4ds 
chapters, and go through the concepts there. These have excellent visuals to 
explain what's going on.

We will also look at the visuals of these concepts [here](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain).

Then, let's go through [Jenny Bryans's join cheatsheet](https://stat545.com/join-cheatsheet.html) for examples.
