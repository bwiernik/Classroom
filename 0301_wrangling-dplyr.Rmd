# Wrangle yo' data with **dplyr**


## Today's Topics

Today we'll get started with learning to "wrangle" dataâ€”
that is, to subset it, rearrange it, transform it, summarize it, 
and otherwise make it ready for analysis. 
We are going to be working with the [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package.
Specifically, we're going to consider three lessons today:

- Intro to **dplyr** syntax
- The `|>` pipe and the **dplyr** advantage
- `filter`; relational/comparison and logical operators in R

- Specific **dplyr** functions we will cover
  - `select()`
  - `arrange()`
  - `filter()`
  - `mutate()`
  - `summarize()`
  - `group_by()`
      - grouped `mutate()`
      - grouped `summarize()`
  - `recode()`
  - `across()`
  - `rowwise()`

  - [r4ds: transform](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter.

Here are some supplementary resources:

- A similar resource to the r4ds one above is the [intro to dplyr vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html).
- Want to read more about piping? See [r4ds: pipes](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html).

Some advanced topics you might find useful:

- For window functions and how dplyr handles them, see the [window-functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) vignette for the **dplyr** package. 
- For time series data, see the [tsibble demo](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/)
